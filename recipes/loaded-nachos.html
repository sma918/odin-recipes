<!--Directions and Steps on how to make the dish-->
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>For taco seasoning, stir paprika, garlic powder, cumin, onion powder, chili powder, oregano, and salt together in a small bowl; set aside.</li>
  <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in onion and green pepper; cook and stir with oil and juices from browned meat until much of the liquid has evaporated, about 2 minutes more.</li>
  <li>Stir 1/2 can diced tomatoes with chilies and Mexican-style corn into skillet. Season beef mixture to taste with prepared taco seasoning mix.</li>
  <li>Stir together the remaining 1/2 can diced tomatoes with chilies and refried beans in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on High until heated through, stirring every 30 seconds, 1 to 3 minutes.</li>
  <li>To assemble nachos, lay half of tortilla chips in a single layer on a microwave-safe plate, then drop teaspoons of refried beans onto chips, followed by meat mixture and shredded cheese. Repeat with remaining chips, beans, meat, and cheese to make a second layer.</li>
  <li>Microwave on High until cheese is melted and nachos are warm, 2 to 3 minutes. Top with sour cream, salsa, olives, jalapenos, and green onion as desired.</li>
  <li>Now Enjoy!</li>
