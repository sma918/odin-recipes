This is a project for the Odin Project web dev. course. It's going to end up being a recipe website.
I think that by the end of this project, I will have demonstrated a basic understanding of HTML as that is what the website will be coded in (obviously).
I don't really have much else to say on the topic. Hope it goes well!
